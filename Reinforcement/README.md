The algorithm used is called DQN.

nn.py -- contains code for the network's architecture.

carmunk.py -- environment created with pygame. We've found a simple version
of this environment on the internet and have extended it as we saw fit.

learning.py -- the implementation of the DQN algorithm, parts of which
were written by ourselves and parts put together from different sources.

playing.py -- uses a trained network as an agent to control the car.
