### Instructions how to start the servers

1. First run the StereoCamera.py, it acts as a server for the PhotoServer.py
2. Then run the PhotoServer.py. It connects to the previous script and starts a photo server
3. Now run PhotoClient.py on the other pi (use pi@aerius for the PhotoClient.py and pi@raspberry for everything else)
