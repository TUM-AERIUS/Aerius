# Bounding Boxes CNN
These scripts can be used to train a CNN for the task of single object localization.
The CNN leads a probability whether the object is present in the image or not
and estimate of the bounding boxes coordinates. The loss function used for training
is inspired by the [Fast R-CNN](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7410526/) paper.
